[What Self Driving Cars Tell Us About AI Risks](https://spectrum.ieee.org/self-driving-cars-2662494269)

This article navigates current issues surrounding self driving cars, and what this can tell us about risks in artificial intelligence. One point made is that AI cannot handle a lack of infomation. This is why self driving cars break suddenly about two times as much as human drivers. The car doesn't have information, so it stops, causing many accidents.

A lack of infomration is built into the process of training a large language model. The llm is fed tons of images connected labels contained in a database. The database can only hold a finite amount of labels, and resultingly, not every possibility can be modeled. It is therefore difficult to predict what will fail.
